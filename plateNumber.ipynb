They'd use durable, lightweight fabrics like ripstop nylon or Cordura, potentially incorporating reinforced areas for the jetpack components. Padded straps and back support would be crucial for comfort and weight distribution.\n\n2. **Booster Engine Manufacturing:** This would require a specialized engineering firm.  \n    * **Steam Generation:** A miniaturized boiler and burner system would be needed, possibly using a high-energy, compact fuel source. Precise machining and welding of heat-resistant materials (like stainless steel or titanium) would be essential. Safety features like pressure relief valves would be critical.\n    * **Nozzles:**  Precision-engineered nozzles would direct the steam for thrust, likely requiring 3D printing or CNC machining to achieve the required tolerances.\n    * **Retractable Mechanism:**  A compact and reliable system for deploying and retracting the boosters would be needed.  This could involve hydraulics, pneumatics, or electric motors, along with intricate linkages.\n\n3. **Power System Development:**  \n    * **Battery Production:** A high-capacity, fast-charging battery (likely lithium-ion) would power the ignition system, control circuits, and potentially assist the steam generation. This would involve collaboration with a battery manufacturer.\n    * **USB-C Charging Port Integration:**  Standard USB-C port components would need to be integrated into the backpack design.\n\n4. **Control System Design and Integration:** An electronics manufacturer would develop the circuitry and software to control the jetpack. This would involve:\n    * **Sensors:** Altitude, speed, and fuel level sensors would be crucial.\n    * **Microcontroller:** A powerful microcontroller would manage all systems and respond to user input.\n    * **User Interface:** A simple interface (perhaps a small display and buttons) would allow users to control the jetpack.\n\n5. **Assembly and Testing:** A dedicated facility would handle the final assembly and rigorous testing.  This would include:\n    * **Integration of Components:** Carefully fitting the boosters, power system, and control system within the backpack structure.\n    * **Quality Control:** Thoroughly testing all components and systems to ensure safety and functionality.  This might involve wind tunnel tests, thrust measurements, and flight simulations.\n    * **Safety Certification:** Meeting all relevant safety standards and obtaining necessary certifications before the product can be sold.\n\n6. **Distribution and Sales:**  Traditional retail channels or online sales platforms could handle distribution to consumers.\n\nThis hypothetical jetpack backpack would require collaboration between various specialized manufacturers, meticulous engineering, and rigorous testing.  While the steam-powered aspect is likely more science fiction than reality with current technology, the manufacturing process described above highlights the complexity of such a device.\n"

The narrator explains that Jupiter is the largest and oldest planet in our solar system, and is made up of the same elements as a star, but it didnâ€™t become massive enough to ignite. Jupiter's appearance is caused by a swirling interior of gasses and liquids which create colored cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. The Great Red Spot is a giant storm, and because there is no landmass to slow it down, it has been active for more than a century. In more recent years, the Great Red Spotâ€™s color has deepened, itâ€™s shrinking and getting rounder. Scientists theorized that as it shrinks, the wind speed increases like an ice skater spinning faster by pulling in their arms, but the data collected by various NASA missions including Voyager, Hubble, and Juno shows the storm isn't spinning faster, itâ€™s getting taller. It used to be large enough to fit three Earths, now itâ€™s only slightly bigger than one. Scientists hope further investigation will shed light on its continued changes.Â \n\nHere is a quiz on Jupiter's Great Red Spot:\n\n1.

The view shifts to show how it looked in 2009, noticeably smaller. The image then shifts to 2015, smaller still and now a darker orange hue.\n\n[00:01:00] As the inset image disappears, the Great Red Spot appears to open up, revealing its swirling interior of orange, red, and rust-colored bands.\n\n[00:01:05] As the ice skater demonstrates how spinning faster pulls her arms in, two graphs of data points show the Great Red Spotâ€™s latitude and its relative height above the Jovian surface. A black line shows the data from 2014. A blue line shows the data from 2015, and a green line shows the data from 2016. The lines rise and fall similarly, with the 2015 line consistently rising a bit higher than the 2014 line, and the 2016 line rising slightly above the 2015 line. A red line showing data from 2017 then appears, again following a similar pattern but with a higher overall rise than the other lines.\n\n[00:01:18] A potterâ€™s hands shape a lump of clay on a spinning wheel, raising it from a rounded lump into a tall, narrow form.\n\n[00:01:25] On the face of Jupiter, the inset image from 1995, 2009, and 2015 are shown again, showing the changing size and shape of the Great Red Spot.\n\n[00:01:32] Earth is superimposed on Jupiterâ€™s face, illustrating that what was once large enough to fit three Earths can now only hold just over one.\n\n[00:01:36] A Voyager space probe, and then the Juno probe, both make their appearance in front of Jupiter.\n\n[00:01:54] The Great Red Spot again fills the screen, its roiling surface a dark orange.\n\n[00:01:59] The Goddard Space Flight Center logo fills the screen, the Earth visible at the edge of the screen.\n\nHope this helps!"
